## Repository Health Metrics

### Branch Structure Issues:

- Old feature branches still active
- No clear GitFlow structure

### CI/CD Status:
- ‚ùå No automated CI/CD pipeline
- ‚ùå No branch protection rules
- ‚ùå No automated testing
- ‚ùå No code quality checks

### Database Strategy Decision: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **DECISION**: Maintain hybrid Supabase + Neon approach
- **Supabase**: Main e-commerce (products, cart, orders, auth)
- **Neon**: Wishlist functionality with session persistence
- **Rationale**: Both systems working well, good separation of concerns
- **Status**: Documented in ARCHITECTURE.md

- Created comprehensive documentation suite:

  - DEPLOYMENT.md (Vercel deployment guide)
  - ARCHITECTURE.md (system design and database strategy)
  - TESTING.md (testing strategy and guidelines)
- Updated .env.example with all required variables
- Created PARALLEL_WORK_LOG.md for session coordination

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Phase 2):
