## Session 2 (Features) - Other Session
**Focus**: Feature development, bug fixes  
**Coordination**: Avoid infrastructure files, focus on components/pages

### Recommended Tasks for Other Session:
- [ ] Fix critical bugs (Issues #10, #11, #12)
  - Product images 404 errors
  - Homepage video background regression
  - Wishlist functionality missing
- [ ] Merge ready PRs (#26, #33) after infrastructure setup
- [ ] Investigate and fix PR #27 Vercel deployment failure
- [ ] Test cart functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

### Coordination Guidelines:
- Use `feature/` branch prefix for new work
- Avoid editing infrastructure files (.github/, .eslintrc.json, etc.)
- Coordinate via GitHub PR comments
- Update this log with your progress

## Database Strategy Decision

**DECISION**: Use Neon PostgreSQL as the primary database
- **Neon**: All database functionality (products, cart, orders, auth, wishlist)
- **Rationale**: Simplified architecture, single database provider, better performance

### Implementation Status:
- ✅ Neon client configured (`src/lib/neon.ts`)
- ✅ Environment variables documented
- ✅ Supabase references removed from codebase

---

## Merge Strategy

### Ready to Merge (After Infrastructure Setup):
- **PR #26**: Cart sidebar fixes (CI passing)
- **PR #33**: Toast notifications (CI passing)

### Needs Investigation:
- **PR #27**: Admin panel (Vercel deployment failed)
- **PR #24**: Database migration (CI failures, large scope)

### Coordination Protocol:
1. Infrastructure session creates PR first (lower risk)
2. Feature session waits for infrastructure merge
3. Both sessions use `git pull --rebase` frequently
4. Communicate conflicts via GitHub comments

---

## Emergency Contact:
If conflicts arise:
1. Stop work immediately
2. Document in GitHub issue comments
3. Use `git stash` to save work
4. Coordinate resolution together
