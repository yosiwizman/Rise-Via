=== ROUTING ANALYSIS ===

Routing System: Custom State-Based (No React Router)
- Uses setCurrentPage() state management for navigation
- URL path detection in App.tsx useEffect for direct URL access
- Manual page switching through onNavigate props

Supported Routes (15+ total):
- / (home) - HomePage with hero video and featured products
- /admin - AdminPage with authentication
- /shop - ShopPage with product catalog
- /learn - LearnPage with educational content
- /legal - LegalPage with compliance information
- /contact - ContactPage with contact form
- /wishlist - WishlistPage for saved products
- /account - AccountPage for customer dashboard
- /login - LoginPage for authentication
- /register - RegisterPage for new users
- /b2b or /wholesale - B2BPage for business customers
- /checkout - CheckoutPage with Stripe integration
- /health - HealthCheck system monitoring
- /wishlist-shared - SharedWishlistPage for social sharing
- Default: NotFoundPage for unmatched routes

Navigation Pattern:
- Navigation component receives onNavigate={setCurrentPage}
- Footer component receives onNavigate={setCurrentPage}
- Page components can trigger navigation via onNavigate prop
- URL updates handled manually in App.tsx

=== API & DATA LAYER ANALYSIS ===

Database Configuration:
- Supabase client configured in src/lib/supabase.ts
- Environment variables: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- Admin client with service key for elevated operations
- Test environment with mock Supabase URLs

API Services:
- Email Service: Resend API integration (VITE_RESEND_API_KEY)
- No direct supabase.from() calls found in search
- Suggests data may be loaded from JSON files instead of live database

Data Sources Analysis:
- Products loaded from src/data/products.json (confirmed in ShopPage.tsx)
- Mixed architecture: Database configured but JSON files used for products
- Potential disconnect between documented schema and actual implementation

Environment Variables Used:
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL - Supabase project URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY - Public API key
- VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY - Admin service key
- VITE_RESEND_API_KEY - Email service API key
- NODE_ENV - Development/production detection

=== STATE MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS ===

State Management Architecture:
- Primary: React useState hooks (38+ components using useState)
- Context: CustomerContext for user authentication state
- Local Storage: Extensive use for data persistence (11 files)
- Custom Hooks: useCart, useWishlist, useAgeGate for specialized state

Local Storage Usage:
- Admin Authentication: localStorage.setItem('adminToken', 'admin123')
- Wishlist Analytics: 'risevia-wishlist-analytics' and 'risevia-wishlist-metrics'
- Cart Analytics: Similar pattern for cart data persistence
- Compliance Data: Age verification and state blocking
- Error Handling: Development error logs
- Price Tracking: Historical price data
- Wishlist Service: User wishlist persistence

Custom Hooks Identified:
- useCart.ts - Shopping cart state management with Zustand-like patterns
- useWishlist.ts - Wishlist functionality with localStorage persistence
- useAgeGate.ts - Age verification state management
- use-toast.ts - Toast notification state
- use-mobile.tsx - Mobile responsive state detection

State Patterns:
- Form state management in checkout, contact, registration pages
- Modal state management for product details, QR codes
- Navigation state via setCurrentPage in App.tsx
- Loading states across admin components
- Filter states in shop and admin pages

=== AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY ANALYSIS ===

Authentication Implementation:
- Admin Authentication: Simple localStorage token system (admin/admin123)
- Customer Authentication: CustomerContext with Supabase integration
- Registration: Full form with password validation (min 6 chars)
- Login: LoginPage component with authentication flow
- Age Verification: Required 21+ verification for registration
- B2B Authentication: Separate business customer registration

Security Measures:
- DOMPurify (v3.2.6) for XSS protection
- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Age verification enforcement (21+)
- State compliance checking
- HTTPS enforcement via Vercel
- Environment variable protection for API keys

Security Concerns:
- Admin authentication uses hardcoded credentials (admin/admin123)
- Simple localStorage token without expiration
- No password reset functionality implemented
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts
- No multi-factor authentication

Authentication Flow:
- Registration → Age verification → Terms acceptance → Account creation
- Login → CustomerContext state management
- Admin → localStorage token verification
- B2B → Separate business registration with license verification

=== BUILD & PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ===

Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- Build Time: 4.23 seconds
- TypeScript Compilation: No errors
- Modules Transformed: 2,107 modules
- Vite Version: 6.3.5

Bundle Analysis:
- Main Bundle: 822.44 kB (240.12 kB gzipped)
- CSS Bundle: 84.22 kB (13.44 kB gzipped)
- HTML: 0.46 kB (0.30 kB gzipped)
- Additional JS: 0.03 kB (render_resend utility)

Performance Warnings:
🟡 Large Bundle Warning: Main chunk >500kB after minification
